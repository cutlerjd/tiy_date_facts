# Date Facts
### The Iron Yard Las Vegas Spring 2017 Cohort

In this project, you will use two packages from NPM and make a script that gives you information about the current date and time. The libraries you will use are:

* [moment](http://momentjs.com/docs/)
* [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk)

When your script runs, it should look at the current date and time and print output that looks like the following.

![Alt Text](date-facts-out.png?raw=true)

* It is [full date format in blue].
* It is the [day of the year in pink] day of the year.
* It is [how many seconds into the day] seconds into the day.
* It [is/is not] during Daylight Savings Time.
* It [is/is not] a leap year.

Your colors may vary because of your terminal colors.
